The program starts in main. here the euid is set to the uid so that both are of the running user. 
if the crypto menu is selected the euid is never changed.
if the employee directory is selected then the directory file is created if it doesnt already exist
the euid is changed to root so that the permissions on the directory file can be set and then the euid is set back to the starting user.
if the user selects to view the directory the euid is unchanged. If the user selects to modify the directory, the euid is changed to root 
in order to read from the password file and then the euid is set immediately back. The program then prompts the user for the admin password and if
it is correct the euid is set to the rootID so modification of the directory file can happen. After modifyDirectory returns which includes add,update and delete
employee then the euid is set back to the origianl users ID. If the user chooses to update the admin password root permissions are given to read the actual 
password from the file and immediately euid is set back untill the user has entered the correct password. If the password entered by the user matches the password
in the password file the user is given root privilages so that the new password can be written to the password file. After the new password is written the euid is 
set back to the startID.
